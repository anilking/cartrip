          <h3>How to Become a Qooley</h3>
          <p>
              Once you’re a registered user, the mobile app will allow you to become a Qooley. In order to become a Qooley, you will be required to provide additional information and go through a background check process. Once we approve you to become a Qooley, you will receive a link to download our QooleyBiz mobile app. QooleyBiz mobile app will provide all the necessary tools for the Qooleys to create unique activities which can be offered on the Qooley platform to the travelers.

          <h3>Browse Local Activities</h3>
          <p>
              Once type-in your destination city, select dates, number of travelers in your group, you’ll be able to view various activities offered exclusively by locals or Qooleys. Don’t find what you’re looking for? Narrow your search results using the filters, or by typing the name of a specific activity (e.g. Skydiving). You can filter the results by selecting any of the following major categories: Adventure, Sightseeing, Food, Entertainment, Night Life, and Drive Me.

          <h3>How to book an Activity</h3>
          <p>
              Once you find an activity that fits your interests, you can tap on the activity to view the details regarding the activity (e.g. meeting location, meeting time, activity description, transportation, accommodations, availability etc.). You can book the activity by tapping on the request booking button. The Qooley offering that particular activity will receive a notification. You’re all set once the Qooley accepts your booking. In case a Qooley denies the booking for whatever reason, you will receive a notification at a reasonable time regarding the status of your booking.
          </p>
          <p>
              Once the booking is confirmed, you will be able to contact the Qooley at a certain time prior to the meet-up time.
