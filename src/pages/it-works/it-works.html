                        required to provide additional information and go through a background check process. Once we approve
                        you to become a Qooley, you will receive a link to download our QooleyBiz mobile app. QooleyBiz mobile
                        app will provide all the necessary tools for the Qooleys to create unique activities which can be

                        Once you find an activity that fits your interests, you can tap on the activity to view the details regarding the activity
                        (e.g. meeting location, meeting time, activity description, transportation, accommodations, availability
                        etc.). You can book the activity by tapping on the request booking button. The Qooley offering that
                        particular activity will receive a notification. You’re all set once the Qooley accepts your booking.
                        In case a Qooley denies the booking for whatever reason, you will receive a notification at a reasonable
                        time regarding the status of your booking.

                        Once the booking is confirmed, you will be able to contact the Qooley at a certain time prior to the meet-up time.
