    <p>Qooley, LLC uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as mobile application and other device identifiers, on

      As a result, when you access or use the Platform, you will provide or make available certain information to us and
      to our business partners.</p>
    <p>While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response

      you click on advertisements for Qooley, LLC services on Third-Party platforms such as search engines and social networks,
      and may use analytics to track what you do in response to those advertisements.</p>
    <p>We may, either directly or through Third Parties we engage to provide services to us, also continue to track your behavior
      on our own Platform for purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development, fraud prevention,
      risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, as well as to enable you to use and access the Platform and
      pay for your activities on the Platform. We may also, either directly or through Third-Parties we engage to provide
      services to us, track your behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services to you on the Platform
      and Third-Party websites. Third Parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements
      on our Platform and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out
      at the websites of industry groups such as the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;Digital Advertising
      Alliance
      <em>.</em>&nbsp;You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s&nbsp;Ad
      Preference Manager. Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still
      receive advertising on or about the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests. In addition, if you
      disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of using our Platform, Application and Services,
      as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your use and access.</p>

      <li><em>Third-Party social plugins</em></li>

    <p>As a result of this, you may send to the Third-Party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of our Platform.
      If you are not logged into your account with the Third-Party, then the Third Party may not know your identity. If you
      are logged into your account with the Third Party, then the Third Party may be able to link information about your
      visit to our Platform to your account with them. Similarly, your interactions with the social plugin may be recorded

      <li><strong><u>How Qooley, LLC uses and processes the information that you provide or make available</u></strong>
        <u></u>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We use, store and process information about you for the following general purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable you to access and use the Platform.</li>
      <li>To enable you to communicate with other Members, including but not limited to by sending them messages or other information
        during the Booking process.</li>
      <li>To operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, Qooley, LLC’s business, and our users’ experience, such as
        to perform analytics, conduct research, personalize or otherwise customize your experience, and to provide customer
        service.
      </li>
      <li>To help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform and Services, such as detection and prevention
        of actual and potential fraud and other harmful activity, conducting investigations and risk assessments, enforcing
        our Terms and policies, verifying the address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided by you (including
        by comparing the photo on that identification to another photo you provide to us), and conducting checks against
        databases and information sources (such as but not limited to public government databases) for fraud detection and
        prevention, risk assessment and harm prevention purposes. In this regard, we may do any or all of the foregoing with
        or without further notifying you.</li>
      <li>To send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and
        information requested by you.</li>
      <li>To send you marketing, advertising, and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you,
        including information about Qooley, LLC, our services, or general promotions for partner campaigns and services.</li>
      <li>To administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events

      <li>To comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce our

    <ol start="4">
      <li><strong><u>How Qooley, LLC Uses and Processes User Communications</u></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>We may, either directly or through Third-Parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications
      with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation,
      product development, research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts,
      the Platform may scan and analyze messages and attachments to mask contact information and references to other websites.
      This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Travelers to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by
      bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product
      development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as
      to debug, improve and expand product offerings. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for sending
      Third-Party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to Third Parties.
      We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably possible. However, from
      time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that Qooley, LLC,
      in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through Third-Parties we engage to provide services to us, review,
      scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p>
     
    <ol start="5">
      <li><strong><u>When Qooley, LLC discloses or shares your personal information, and to whom</u></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
    <p>We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of
      the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) including the United States and possibly other countries. By using
      the Platform, you consent to transferring your data to these countries. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction
      to jurisdiction, and so laws and regulations relating to privacy and data disclosure, applicable to the places where
      your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the laws and regulations
      applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>
    <p>Your Personal Information may be transferred, stored, used, processed and disclosed as follows:</p>
    <p>(a) Parts of your public profile page that contain some Personal Information may be displayed in other parts of the Platform
      to other users for marketing purposes or if you post content in a community forum or other features on the Platform
      that are visible to the general public.</p>
    <p>(b) Your public listing of “Activity” (or “Service”) will always include some minimum information such as the city and
      neighborhood where the “Activity” (or “Service”) is located, your “Activity” (or “Service”) description, your calendar
      availability, your public profile photo, your responsiveness in replying to Travelers’ queries, and any additional
      information you share with other Members. The Platform may also display the “Activity’s” (or “Service”) approximate
      geographic location on a map, such that a user can see the general area of the “Activity” (or “Service”).</p>
    <p>(c) The Platform allows your public profile and public listings of “Activity” (or “Service”) to be included in search
      engines, in which case your public profile and public listings will be indexed by search engines and may be published
      as search results. This option is enabled by default, and you may opt out of this feature by changing your settings
      on the Platform. If you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages, Third-Party
      search engines may not update their databases quickly or at all. We do not control the practices of Third-Party search
      engines, and they may use caches containing outdated information, including any information indexed by the search engine
      before you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public listings of “Activity” (or “Service”).</p>
    <p>(d) When you submit a request to book an “Activity” (or “Service”), your full name, and the full name of any confirmed
      Travelers staying with you, and other Personal Information you agree to pass through to the Qooley(s) will become visible
      to the Qooley(s) of any “Activity” (or “Service”) you Book or request to Book. We may also disclose parts of your public
      profile, other Member reviews of you, and any additional information you share with other Members. In addition, if
      you agree to be contacted by the Qooley(s) by phone after your request to Book is accepted, and the Qooley(s) decides
      to do so, the phone number of Qooley will be masked. We will not share your phone number unless there is a confirmed
      booking; if there is a confirmed booking, your phone number will become visible to the Qooley(s)/Traveler, who may
      call you directly.</p>
    <p>(e) When your request to book an “Activity” (or “Service”) is accepted by the Qooley(s) or when a Traveler books your
      “Activity” (or “Service”), we will disclose some of your Personal Information to the Qooley(s) and any confirmed Traveler(s).
      However, your billing and payout information will never be shared with another user.<br> (f) When a Traveler participates
      in your “Activity” (or “Service”) and vice versa, we may ask you to review the Traveler, Qooley, or the “Activity”
      (or “Service”). If you choose to provide a review, your review may be public on the Platform. Likewise, another Member’s
      review of you as a Traveler or Qooley may be public on the Platform.</p>
    <p>(g) You may link your account on a Third-Party social networking site to your Qooley, LLC Account. We refer to a person’s
      contacts on these Third-Party sites as “Friends”. When you create this linkage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be published on your Qooley, LLC Account
        profile.</li>
      <li>Your activities on the Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Platform and/or that Third-Party site.</li>
      <li>A link to your public profile on that Third-Party social networking site may be included in your Qooley, LLC public
        profile.
      </li>
      <li>Other members may be able to see any common Friends that you may have with them, or that you are a Friend of their
        Friend if applicable.</li>
      <li>Other members may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your
        linked social networking site(s).</li>
      <li>The information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud
        prevention and risk assessment purposes.</li>
      <li>The publication and display of information that you provide to Qooley, LLC through this linkage is subject to your
        settings and authorizations on the Platform and the Third-Party site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(h) We may distribute parts of the Platform (including your listings of “Activity” (or “Service”)) for display on sites
      operated by Qooley, LLC’s business partners and affiliates, using technologies such as HTML widgets. If and when your
      listings are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed.</p>
    <p>(i) Qooley, LLC may provide your Personal Information to its Affiliates, including Third-Party Payments Gateway, and
      their employees, to use and process your Personal Information in the same way and to the same extent that we are permitted
      to under this Privacy Policy. These related entities comply with the same obligations that we have to protect your
      Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Qooley, LLC’s Third-Party Payment Gateway vendors may share your Personal
      Information for (i) their everyday business purposes; (ii) to jointly market products or services to you with other
      financial Third Parties with whom Qooley, LLC has a formal agreement; and (iii) with respect to information about your
      transactions and experiences only, for their Affiliates’ everyday purposes. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving
      marketing communications in your settings (in the “Account” section) when you login to your Qooley, LLC account.</p>
    <p>(j) We may also engage Third Parties, who may be located outside of the EEA, to provide services to us, including but
      not limited to technology services and services to help verify your identification, to help match the photo on your
      ID to other photos of yourself you send to us, to conduct checks against databases such as but not limited to public
      government databases (where legally allowed), to otherwise assist us with fraud prevention and risk assessment, to
      assist us with customer service, to serve targeted ads, and to facilitate the payments or reimbursements you request
      (such as Concur and American Express). We may provide Personal Information about you to these Third Parties, or give
      them access to this Personal Information, for the limited purpose of allowing them to provide these services. For example,
      if we hire Third Parties, where permitted by applicable law, to conduct checks against databases such as but not limited
      to public government databases, we may provide your Personal Information, such as your full name, Social Security Number,
      Driver’s License Number and Date of Birth, to the Third Parties for the limited purpose of allowing them to conduct
      such checks, including background or registered sex offender checks, on our behalf. We will ensure that such Third
      Parties have contractual obligations to protect this Personal Information and to not use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
    <p>(k) You acknowledge, consent and agree that Qooley, LLC may access, preserve and disclose your account information and
      Collective Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure
      is reasonably necessary (1) to respond to claims asserted against Qooley, LLC; (2) to comply with legal process (for
      example, subpoenas and warrants), including legal process associated with national security and law enforcement; (3)
      to enforce and administer our agreements with users, such as the&nbsp;Terms &amp; Conditions, the&nbsp;Payment Policy,
      and this Privacy Policy; (4) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development
      and de-bugging purposes; or (5) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Qooley, LLC, its users or members
      of the public.</p>
    <p>(l) We may also publish, disclose and use Aggregated Information and non-personal information for industry and market
      analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Referral service and requesting references</strong></p>
    <p>The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the Platform. The
      Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on your Qooley,
      LLC profile.</p>
    <p>We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests
      for references via the third-party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third-party site, and Qooley, LLC
      does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.</p>
    <p>You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the contact information
      to which to send your invitation/request. You can type in the email addresses or other contact information manually,
      or you can choose to import the contacts in your address book(s). In both cases, we may use and store this information
      for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends and contacts an invitation or request for a reference, and
      for fraud detection and prevention. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your invitees
      to track if your friend joins Qooley, LLC in response to your referral.</p>
    <p>If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for the email account
      you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose of importing your contacts.

      could allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information.</p>
    <p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether
      to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at
      all without cookies.</p>
    <p><strong>(a) Qooley, LLC cookies and Third Party cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Qooley, LLC may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our
      treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p>
    <p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web
      analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, Third Parties may also place
      cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p>
    <p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely “persistent cookies” and “session cookies”.</p>
    <p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device
      after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p>
    <p><strong>(b) Other technologies</strong></p>
    <p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking
      URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine
      whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p>
    <p><strong>(c) Uses for Qooley, LLC cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Qooley, LLC uses cookies and similar tracking technologies for a number of purposes, such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages, devices and browser
        sessions.
      </li>
      <li>To simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>
      <li>To monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize
        it.
      </li>
      <li>To show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>
      <li>For fraud detection and prevention.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>(d) Uses for Third-Party cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to Qooley, LLC. For example, Third
      Parties we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise Qooley,
      LLC listings or services to you on the Platform and Third-party websites, or to help us detect or prevent fraud or
      conduct risk assessments. Third Parties websites that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted
      advertisements on our Platform and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements
      by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;Digital
      Advertising Alliance. You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s&nbsp;Ad
      Preference Manager. Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still
      receive advertising on or about the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
    <p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information
      to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the Qooley, LLC mobile app on Facebook
      and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified)
      has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using
      the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p>
    <p><strong>(e) Disabling Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the
      Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign
      in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash cookies operate differently than browser
      cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about
      how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the&nbsp;Adobe website&nbsp;and make changes at the&nbsp;Global Privacy
      Settings Panel.</p>

      either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.</p>

      we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Platform and Services
      and deactivate your Qooley Member Account.</p>
