                    <p>In particular, a Qooley should understand how the laws work in their respective cities. Depending on
                        the type or nature of a services offered, there may be certain laws restricting the Qooley from offering
                        those services without a permit, or a license. Local governments vary greatly in how they enforce
                        these laws. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement. A Qooley should review local laws before
                        listing a “Activity” on QooleyBiz.</p>

                        action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Qooley, LLC otherwise
                        agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
                        preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
                        unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except
                        as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination

                    <p class="li-data-margin">Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration
                        Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered
                        by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules
                        (the “AAA Rules“) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA
                        Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_medor by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration
                        Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Arbitration Process.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration
                        as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will
                        be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware and will
                        be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties
                        are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration,
                        then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Arbitration Location and Procedure.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Unless you and Qooley, LLC otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you
                        reside. If your claim does not exceed $5,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
                        basis of documents you and Qooley, LLC submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or
                        the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $5,000, your right to
                        a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have
                        the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
                        expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Arbitrator’s Decision.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s
                        decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the
                        award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
                        The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability”
                        section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The
                        arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the
                        extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in
                        arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided
                        under applicable law. Qooley, LLC will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable
                        law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin" id="one">Fees.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth
                        in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Qooley, LLC will pay
                        all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
                        in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured
                        by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Changes.</p>
                    <p class="li-data-margin">Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Qooley, LLC changes this “Dispute
