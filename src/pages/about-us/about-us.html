      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        We got this idea in Summer 2015’ while backpacking in Europe. We noticed that we were in the same situation as many fellow
        travelers – clueless without a guide, relying on Google searches and reviews written on travel websites. As passionate
        travelers, we were bothered by these trends in traveling. While the backpackers experienced difficulties finding
        the right adventures to meet their interests, we noticed that many solo travelers, as well as traveling families,
        missed out on a true traveling experience. A true traveling experience in our view is the one which helps you live
        and experience the culture, immerse in local traditions, taste the local cuisine, and most importantly make life-long
        connections with the locals. In January 2017, we founded Qooley, LLC in an effort to change the current trends in
        travel, and provide a platform that allows travelers to book a true traveling experience.</p>

      <h3> Our Mission</h3>

      <p>At Qooley, our mission is to connect people from all over the world and promote cultural exchange. Our goal is to provide
        a platform that allows people to learn about different ideas and skills, form life-long relationships, and gain new
        perspectives. Furthermore, we want to create an opportunity for the locals (Qooleys) to offer unique travel experiences.</p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Our vision is to create a new trend in traveling where travelers can explore their destinations from the perspective of a
        local (Qooley)– the best way to learn about the culture, history, food, traditions, lifestyle, and most importantly,
        the people. Why explore the city on your own when you can have the company of a local to show you the hidden gems
        in the city!
